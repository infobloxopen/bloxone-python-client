# ipam-federation
The DDI IPAM Federation application enables a SaaS administrator to manage multiple IPAM systems from one central control point CSP.    

The `ipam_federation` package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: v1
- Package version: 0.1.0
- Generator version: 7.5.0
- Build package: com.infoblox.codegen.UniversalDdiPythonClientCodegen

## Requirements.

Python 3.7+

## Installation & Usage

This python library package is generated without supporting files like setup.py or requirements files

To be able to use it, you will need these dependencies in your own package that uses this library:

* urllib3 >= 1.25.3
* python-dateutil
* pydantic

## Getting Started

In your own code, to use this library to connect and interact with ipam-federation,
you can run the following:

```python

# Defining the Portal URL is optional and defaults to "https://csp.infoblox.com"import ipam_federation
from ipam_federation.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the Portal URL is optional and defaults to "https://csp.infoblox.com"
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = Configuration(
    portal_url = os.getenv('INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL'),
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.

# Configure Portal key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.portal_key = os.getenv("INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY")


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ipam_federation.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ipam_federation.FederatedBlockApi(api_client)
    body = ipam_federation.FederatedBlock() # FederatedBlock | 

    try:
        # Create the federated block.
        api_response = api_instance.create(body)
        print("The response of FederatedBlockApi->create:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling FederatedBlockApi->create: %s\n" % e)

```
