## Example

```python
from ipam.models.address import Address

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Address from a JSON string
address_instance = Address.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Address.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
address_dict = address_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Address from a dict
address_from_dict = Address.from_dict(address_dict)
