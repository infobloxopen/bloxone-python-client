## Example

```python
from ipam.models.ha_group import HAGroup

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of HAGroup from a JSON string
ha_group_instance = HAGroup.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(HAGroup.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
ha_group_dict = ha_group_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of HAGroup from a dict
ha_group_from_dict = HAGroup.from_dict(ha_group_dict)
