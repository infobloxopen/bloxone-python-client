### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):
```python
import os
from pprint import pprint

import infra_mgmt

from bloxone_client.api_client import ApiClient
from bloxone_client.configuration import Configuration

# Defining the CSP URL is optional and defaults to "https://csp.infoblox.com"
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = Configuration(
    csp_url = os.getenv('BLOXONE_CSP_URL'),
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key = os.getenv("BLOXONE_API_KEY")

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ApiClient(config) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = infra_mgmt.DetailApi(api_client)

    try:
        # List all the Hosts along with its associated Services (applications).
        api_response = api_instance.hosts_list()
        pprint("The response of DetailApi->hosts_list:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        pprint("Exception when calling DetailApi->hosts_list: %s\n" % e)
```



### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **filter** | **str**|   A collection of response resources can be filtered by a logical expression string that includes JSON tag references to values in each resource, literal values, and logical operators. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.  Literal values include numbers (integer and floating-point), and quoted (both single- or double-quoted) literal strings, and &#39;null&#39;. The following operators are commonly used in filter expressions:  |  Op   |  Description               |  |  --   |  -----------               |  |  &#x3D;&#x3D;   |  Equal                     |  |  !&#x3D;   |  Not Equal                 |  |  &gt;    |  Greater Than              |  |   &gt;&#x3D;  |  Greater Than or Equal To  |  |  &lt;    |  Less Than                 |  |  &lt;&#x3D;   |  Less Than or Equal To     |  |  and  |  Logical AND               |  |  ~    |  Matches Regex             |  |  !~   |  Does Not Match Regex      |  |  or   |  Logical OR                |  |  not  |  Logical NOT               |  |  ()   |  Groupping Operators       |         | [optional] 
 **order_by** | **str**|   A collection of response resources can be sorted by their JSON tags. For a &#39;flat&#39; resource, the tag name is straightforward. If sorting is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.)  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names. The sort direction can be specified by a suffix separated by whitespace before the tag name. The suffix &#39;asc&#39; sorts the data in ascending order. The suffix &#39;desc&#39; sorts the data in descending order. If no suffix is specified the data is sorted in ascending order.         | [optional] 
 **offset** | **int**|   The integer index (zero-origin) of the offset into a collection of resources. If omitted or null the value is assumed to be &#39;0&#39;.          | [optional] 
 **limit** | **int**|   The integer number of resources to be returned in the response. The service may impose maximum value. If omitted the service may impose a default value.          | [optional] 
 **page_token** | **str**|   The service-defined string used to identify a page of resources. A null value indicates the first page.          | [optional] 
 **fields** | **str**|   A collection of response resources can be transformed by specifying a set of JSON tags to be returned. For a “flat” resource, the tag name is straightforward. If field selection is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, the tag does not appear in the output resource.  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names.         | [optional] 
 **tfilter** | **str**| This parameter is used for filtering by tags. | [optional] 
 **torder_by** | **str**| This parameter is used for sorting by tags. | [optional]
