### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
import infra_mgmt
from infra_mgmt.models.list_detail_hosts_response import ListDetailHostsResponse
from infra_mgmt.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://csp.infoblox.com/api/infra/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = infra_mgmt.Configuration(
    host = "http://csp.infoblox.com/api/infra/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['ApiKeyAuth'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKeyAuth'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with infra_mgmt.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class

    filter = 'filter_example' # str |   A collection of response resources can be filtered by a logical expression string that includes JSON tag references to values in each resource, literal values, and logical operators. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.  Literal values include numbers (integer and floating-point), and quoted (both single- or double-quoted) literal strings, and 'null'.

If sorting is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.)  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names. The sort direction can be specified by a suffix separated by whitespace before the tag name. The suffix 'asc' sorts the data in ascending order. The suffix 'desc' sorts the data in descending order. If no suffix is specified the data is sorted in ascending order.         (optional)
    offset = 56 # int |   The integer index (zero-origin) of the offset into a collection of resources. If omitted or null the value is assumed to be '0'.          (optional)
    limit = 56 # int |   The integer number of resources to be returned in the response. The service may impose maximum value. If omitted the service may impose a default value.          (optional)

    fields = 'fields_example' # str |   A collection of response resources can be transformed by specifying a set of JSON tags to be returned. For a “flat” resource, the tag name is straightforward. If field selection is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy.
