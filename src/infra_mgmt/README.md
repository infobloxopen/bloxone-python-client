# infra-mgmt
The **Infrastructure Management API** provides a RESTful interface to manage Infrastructure Hosts and Services objects.  The following is a list of the different Services and their string types (the string types are to be used with the APIs for the `service_type` field):  | Service name | Service type |   | ------ | ------ |   | Access Authentication | authn |   | Anycast | anycast |   | Data Connector | cdc |   | DHCP | dhcp |   | DNS | dns |   | DNS Forwarding Proxy | dfp |   | NIOS Grid Connector | orpheus |   | MS AD Sync | msad |   | NTP | ntp |   | BGP | bgp |   | RIP | rip |   | OSPF | ospf |    ---   ### Hosts API  The Hosts API is used to manage the Infrastructure Host resources. These include various operations related to hosts such as viewing, creating, updating, replacing, disconnecting, and deleting Hosts. Management of Hosts is done from the Cloud Services Portal (CSP) by navigating to the Manage -> Infrastructure -> Hosts tab.  ---   ### Services API  The Services API is used to manage the Infrastructure Service resources (a.k.a. BloxOne applications). These include various operations related to hosts such as viewing, creating, updating, starting/stopping, configuring, and deleting Services. Management of Services is done from the Cloud Services Portal (CSP) by navigating to the Manage -> Infrastructure -> Services tab.  ---   ### Detail APIs  The Detail APIs are read-only APIs used to list all the Infrastructure resources (Hosts and Services). Each resource record returned also contains information about its other associated resources and the status information for itself and the associated resource(s) (i.e., Host/Service status).  ---   

The `infra_mgmt` package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: v1
- Package version: 0.1.0
- Generator version: 7.5.0
- Build package: com.infoblox.codegen.BloxonePythonClientCodegen

## Requirements.

Python 3.7+

## Installation & Usage

This python library package is generated without supporting files like setup.py or requirements files

To be able to use it, you will need these dependencies in your own package that uses this library:

* urllib3 >= 1.25.3
* python-dateutil
* pydantic

## Getting Started

In your own code, to use this library to connect and interact with infra-mgmt,
you can run the following:

```python

import infra_mgmt
from infra_mgmt.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://csp.infoblox.com/api/infra/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = infra_mgmt.Configuration(
    host = "http://csp.infoblox.com/api/infra/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['ApiKeyAuth'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKeyAuth'] = 'Bearer'


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with infra_mgmt.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = infra_mgmt.DetailApi(api_client)
    filter = 'filter_example' # str |   A collection of response resources can be filtered by a logical expression string that includes JSON tag references to values in each resource, literal values, and logical operators. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.  Literal values include numbers (integer and floating-point), and quoted (both single- or double-quoted) literal strings, and 'null'. The following operators are commonly used in filter expressions:  |  Op   |  Description               |  |  --   |  -----------               |  |  ==   |  Equal                     |  |  !=   |  Not Equal                 |  |  >    |  Greater Than              |  |   >=  |  Greater Than or Equal To  |  |  <    |  Less Than                 |  |  <=   |  Less Than or Equal To     |  |  and  |  Logical AND               |  |  ~    |  Matches Regex             |  |  !~   |  Does Not Match Regex      |  |  or   |  Logical OR                |  |  not  |  Logical NOT               |  |  ()   |  Groupping Operators       |         (optional)
    order_by = 'order_by_example' # str |   A collection of response resources can be sorted by their JSON tags. For a 'flat' resource, the tag name is straightforward. If sorting is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.)  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names. The sort direction can be specified by a suffix separated by whitespace before the tag name. The suffix 'asc' sorts the data in ascending order. The suffix 'desc' sorts the data in descending order. If no suffix is specified the data is sorted in ascending order.         (optional)
    offset = 56 # int |   The integer index (zero-origin) of the offset into a collection of resources. If omitted or null the value is assumed to be '0'.          (optional)
    limit = 56 # int |   The integer number of resources to be returned in the response. The service may impose maximum value. If omitted the service may impose a default value.          (optional)
    page_token = 'page_token_example' # str |   The service-defined string used to identify a page of resources. A null value indicates the first page.          (optional)
    fields = 'fields_example' # str |   A collection of response resources can be transformed by specifying a set of JSON tags to be returned. For a “flat” resource, the tag name is straightforward. If field selection is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, the tag does not appear in the output resource.  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names.         (optional)
    tfilter = 'tfilter_example' # str | This parameter is used for filtering by tags. (optional)
    torder_by = 'torder_by_example' # str | This parameter is used for sorting by tags. (optional)

    try:
        # List all the Hosts along with its associated Services (applications).
        api_response = api_instance.hosts_list(filter=filter, order_by=order_by, offset=offset, limit=limit, page_token=page_token, fields=fields, tfilter=tfilter, torder_by=torder_by)
        print("The response of DetailApi->hosts_list:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling DetailApi->hosts_list: %s\n" % e)
