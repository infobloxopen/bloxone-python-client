    Schedule Software/Config Updates

    Infoblox by default does automatic software updates when they become available. Updates are applied to all on-prem hosts, physical or virtual. However, you can override and schedule the software updates. You can also defer the updates to a later date and time. You can configure up to a total of 50 deferrals (scheduled and deferred software updates), which means you have the flexibility to create up to 50 update groups across different on-prem hosts by mapping with appropriate tags. Tags are be used to associate deferrals (scheduled or deferred) with a specific or group of onprem-hosts. Apart from software update deferrals, config update deferrals also can be configured using these overrides.
