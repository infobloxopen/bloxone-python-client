The flags that are currently used are: <ul><li> __U__: Indicates that the output maps to a URI (Uniform Record Identifier). </li><li> __S__: Indicates that the output is a domain name that has at least one SRV record.

The range of the value is 0 to 65535. <br><br> | Yes preference  |A 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the order in which NAPTR records with equal \"order\" values should be processed, low numbers being processed before high numbers. This is similar to the preference field in an MX record, and is used so domain administrators can direct clients towards more capable hosts or lighter weight protocols. A client may look at records with higher preference values if it has a good reason to do so such as not understanding the preferred protocol or service.

This can be an absolute or relative domain name. Can be empty.<br><br> | Yes services | Specifies the service(s) available down this rewrite path. It may also specify the particular protocol that is used to talk with a service. A protocol must be specified if the flags field states that the NAPTR is terminal. If a protocol is specified, but the flags field does not state that the NAPTR is terminal, the next lookup must be for a NAPTR. The client may choose not to perform the next lookup if the protocol is unknown, but that behavior must not be relied upon.<br><br>The service field may take any of the values below (using the Augmented BNF of RFC 2234):<br><br>service_field = [ [protocol] *(\"+\" rs)]<br>protocol = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM<br>rs = ALPHA * 31 ALPHANUM<br><br>The protocol and rs fields are limited to 32 characters and must start with an alphabetic character.<br><br> For example, an optional protocol specification followed by 0 or more resolution services. Each resolution service is indicated by an initial '+' character.<br><br> Note that the empty string is also a valid service field.  This will typically be seen at the beginning of a series of rules, when it is impossible to know what services and protocols will be offered by a particular service.<br><br> The actual format of the service request and response will be determined by the resolution protocol. Protocols need not offer all services. The labels for service requests shall be formed from the set of characters [A-Z0-9]. The case of the alphabetic characters is not significant.<br><br> | Yes  Subfields for _NS_ (Name Server) record:  Subfield | Description                         | Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- dname    | A domain-name which specifies a host which should be authoritative for the specified class and domain.

Can be absolute or relative domain name.<br><br> | Yes negative_ttl | The time interval in seconds for which name servers can cache negative responses for zone. <br><br>Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).<br><br> | No refresh      | The time interval in seconds that specifies how often secondary servers need to send a message to the primary server for a zone to check that their data is current, and retrieve fresh data if it is not.<br><br>Defaults to 10800 seconds (3 hours).<br><br> | No retry        | The time interval in seconds for which the secondary server will wait before attempting to recontact the primary server after a connection failure occurs.<br><br>Defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).<br><br> | No rname        | The domain name which specifies the mailbox of the person responsible for this zone. <br><br> | No serial       | An unsigned 32-bit integer that specifies the serial number of the zone. Used to indicate that zone data was updated, so the secondary name server can initiate zone transfer. The range of the value is 0 to 4294967295. <br><br> | No  Subfields for _SRV_ (Service) record:  Subfield | Description                         | Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- port     | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the port on this target host of this service. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. This is often as specified in Assigned Numbers but need not be.<br><br> | Yes priority | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies the priority of this target host. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. A client must attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority it can reach. Target hosts with the same priority should be tried in an order defined by the _weight_ field.<br><br>| Yes target   | The domain name of the target host. There must be one or more address records for this name, the name must not be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181).<br><br>A target of \".\" means that the service is decidedly not available at this domain. | Yes weight   | An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. Larger weights should be given a proportionately higher probability of being selected. Domain administrators should use weight 0 when there isn't any server selection to do, to make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of records containing weights greater than 0, records with weight 0 should have a very small chance of being selected.<br><br>In the absence of a protocol whose specification calls for the use of other weighting information, a client arranges the SRV RRs of the same priority in the order in which target hosts, specified by the SRV RRs, will be contacted.<br><br>Defaults to 0.<br><br>| No  Subfields for _TXT_ (Text) record:  Subfield | Description                         | Required ---------|-------------------------------------|--------- text     | The semantics of the text depends on the domain where it is found.<br><br> | No  Generic record can be used to represent any DNS resource record not listed above.
