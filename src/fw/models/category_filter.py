    Infoblox FW API

    Infoblox Threat Defense Cloud is an extension of the Infoblox Suite that provides visibility into infected and compromised off-premises devices, roaming users, remote sites, and branch offices. You can subscribe to Infoblox Cloud and use its functionality to mitigate and control malware as well as provide unprecedented insight into your network security posture and enable timely action. Infoblox Cloud also offers unified policy management, reporting, and threat analytics across the entire spectrum. Using automated and high-quality threat intelligence feeds and unique behavioral analytics, it automatically stops device communications with C&Cs/botnets and prevents DNS based data exfiltration.  The mission-critical DNS infrastructure can become a vulnerable component in your network when it is inadequately protected by traditional security solutions and consequently used as an attack surface. Compromised DNS services can result in catastrophic network and system failures. To fully protect your network in todayâ€™s cyber security threat environment, Infoblox sets a new DNS security standard by offering scalable, enterprise-grade, and integrated protection for your DNS infrastructure.  Through the Infoblox Cloud Services Portal, you can view the status of your subscription and threat intelligence feeds, manage your network scope and roaming end users, and learn more about threats on your networks through the Infoblox Threat Lookup tool and predefined reports.

    The Category Filter object.  Category filters are content categorization rules that Infoblox Cloud uses to detect and filter specific internet content. Based on your configuration, specific actions such as Allow or Block, will be taken on the detected content. Infoblox Cloud provides the following content categories from which you can build your category filters: Drugs, Risk/Fraud/Crime, Entertainment/Culture, Purchasing, Information/Communication, Business/Services, Information Technology, Lifestyle, Society/Education/Religion, Mature/Violent, Games/Gambling, Pornography/Nudity and Uncategorized. Each of these categories contains sub-categories that further define the respective content. When you configure your category filter, you can add as many sub-categories as you need. You then add the category filter to your security policy and assign the Block action for the filter.
