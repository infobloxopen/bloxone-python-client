# **list_threat_feeds**
> ThreatFeedMultiResponse list_threat_feeds(filter=filter, fields=fields, offset=offset, limit=limit, page_token=page_token)

List Threat Feeds.

Use this method to retrieve information on all Threat Feed objects for the account.  BloxOne Cloud provides predefined threat intelligence feeds based on your subscription. The Plus subscription offers a few more feeds than the Standard subscription. The Advanced subscription offers a few more feeds than the Plus subscription. A threat feed subscription for RPZ updates offers protection against malicious hostnames.  

### Example


```python
import fw
from fw.models.threat_feed_multi_response import ThreatFeedMultiResponse
from fw.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://csp.infoblox.com/api/atcfw/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = fw.Configuration(
    host = "https://csp.infoblox.com/api/atcfw/v1"
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fw.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = fw.ThreatFeedsApi(api_client)
    filter = 'filter_example' # str | A collection of response resources can be filtered by a logical expression string that includes JSON tag references to values in each resource, literal values, and logical operators. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.  Literal values include numbers (integer and floating-point), and quoted (both single- or double-quoted) literal strings, and 'null'.  You can filter by following fields:  | Name               | type   | Supported Op                | | ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- | | name               | string | !=, ==, ~, !~, >, <, <=, >= |  In addition grouping operators are supported:  | Op  | Description          | | --- | -------------------- | | and | Logical AND          | | or  | Logical OR           | | not | Logical NOT          | | ()  | Grouping Operators  |  Example: ``` ?_filter=\"((name=='AntiMalware')or(name~'FarSightNOD'))\" ```  (optional)
    fields = 'fields_example' # str |   A collection of response resources can be transformed by specifying a set of JSON tags to be returned. For a “flat” resource, the tag name is straightforward. If field selection is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, the tag does not appear in the output resource.  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names.         (optional)
    offset = 56 # int |   The integer index (zero-origin) of the offset into a collection of resources. If omitted or null the value is assumed to be '0'.          (optional)
    limit = 56 # int |   The integer number of resources to be returned in the response. The service may impose maximum value. If omitted the service may impose a default value.          (optional)
    page_token = 'page_token_example' # str |   The service-defined string used to identify a page of resources. A null value indicates the first page.          (optional)

    try:
        # List Threat Feeds.
        api_response = api_instance.list_threat_feeds(filter=filter, fields=fields, offset=offset, limit=limit, page_token=page_token)
        print("The response of ThreatFeedsApi->list_threat_feeds:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling ThreatFeedsApi->list_threat_feeds: %s\n" % e)
```



### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **filter** | **str**| A collection of response resources can be filtered by a logical expression string that includes JSON tag references to values in each resource, literal values, and logical operators. If a resource does not have the specified tag, its value is assumed to be null.  Literal values include numbers (integer and floating-point), and quoted (both single- or double-quoted) literal strings, and &#39;null&#39;.  You can filter by following fields:  | Name               | type   | Supported Op                | | ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- | | name               | string | !&#x3D;, &#x3D;&#x3D;, ~, !~, &gt;, &lt;, &lt;&#x3D;, &gt;&#x3D; |  In addition grouping operators are supported:  | Op  | Description          | | --- | -------------------- | | and | Logical AND          | | or  | Logical OR           | | not | Logical NOT          | | ()  | Grouping Operators  |  Example: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ?_filter&#x3D;\&quot;((name&#x3D;&#x3D;&#39;AntiMalware&#39;)or(name~&#39;FarSightNOD&#39;))\&quot; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  | [optional] 
 **fields** | **str**|   A collection of response resources can be transformed by specifying a set of JSON tags to be returned. For a “flat” resource, the tag name is straightforward. If field selection is allowed on non-flat hierarchical resources, the service should implement a qualified naming scheme such as dot-qualification to reference data down the hierarchy. If a resource does not have the specified tag, the tag does not appear in the output resource.  Specify this parameter as a comma-separated list of JSON tag names.         | [optional] 
 **offset** | **int**|   The integer index (zero-origin) of the offset into a collection of resources. If omitted or null the value is assumed to be &#39;0&#39;.          | [optional] 
 **limit** | **int**|   The integer number of resources to be returned in the response. The service may impose maximum value. If omitted the service may impose a default value.          | [optional] 
 **page_token** | **str**|   The service-defined string used to identify a page of resources. A null value indicates the first page.          | [optional]
