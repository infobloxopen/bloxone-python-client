# NetworkList

The Network List object.  Before you can apply security policies, you must first define the networks that you want to protect from malicious attacks. The first step in configuring Infoblox Cloud is to set up DNS Firewall by defining your remote networks. You identify these external networks by their IP addresses. A network can contain a group of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or blocks.

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NetworkList from a JSON string
network_list_instance = NetworkList.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(NetworkList.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
network_list_dict = network_list_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NetworkList from a dict
network_list_from_dict = NetworkList.from_dict(network_list_dict)
