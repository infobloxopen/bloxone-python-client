# NamedListRead

The Named List object.  The Named List object represents several types of lists allowed for Infoblox Cloud such as predefined threat intelligence feeds that your subscription offers (Threat Insight, Fast Flux, DGA, DNSM). In addition to the predefined threat intelligence feeds that your subscription offers, you can create custom lists (containing domains and IP addresses) to define whitelists and blacklists for additional protection. You can use a custom list to complement existing feeds or override the Block, Allow, Log, or Redirect action that is currently defined for an existing feed. Note that lists representing predefined TI feeds cannot be created, updated and deleted.

```python
from fw.models.named_list_read import NamedListRead

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NamedListRead from a JSON string
named_list_read_instance = NamedListRead.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(NamedListRead.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
named_list_read_dict = named_list_read_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NamedListRead from a dict
named_list_read_from_dict = NamedListRead.from_dict(named_list_read_dict)
